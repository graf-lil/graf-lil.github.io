# Welcome
Welcome to my personal website! I am currently working as a university assistant at the Department of Developmental and Educational Psychology at the [Univeristy of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/) and about to finish my PhD at the [VDS CoBeNe](https://vds-cobene.univie.ac.at/). My research interests are academic emotions, civic education and political socialization. 

On this website, you can find my [CV](/cv/), a list of [publications and contributions to conferences](/publications/) and an overview of [courses and workshops](/teaching/) I taught up to now. If you are interested in my research, have any questions or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out via e-mail.
